<h4>Hello!</h4>
<h6>Today I have completed a website related Table Lamp from where anyone can choose any Table Lamp for any
        design, also can confirm order by confirmation, and also successfully shipped the order from order management system.</h6>
<br>
<h6>As this is a e-commerce related website, basically there are some feature about management. In below I will
        explain it by some point--</h6>
<ul>
        <li>
                In Home page there are 7section related Table Lamp where are also a section which is included
                Product
        </li>
        <li>
                By Order Now click anyone will go to a private route page which related confirmation form about Order Confirm
                if he/she logged in as this is a private route
        </li>
        <li>
                After properly fill up confirm form he/she buy a Lamp and it will added automatically in Dashboard with status
        </li>
        <li>
                For normal user, User can see Pay, My Orders and Review section in Dashboard
        </li>
        <li>
                Also I have setup admin Dashboard for Manage All Orders, Manage Products, Make Admin and Add New Product
        </li>
        <li>
                In Manage All Orders Page, only Admin can manage every orders like shipped or pending or cancelling any order
        </li>
        <li>
                In Add New Product, Only Admin can add new Product Item
        </li>
        <li>
                In Manage Product Page, only Admin can manage every product, Admin can delete any product from the website
        </li>
        <li>
                The most powerful option Make New Admin, only An admin can do this
        </li>
        <li>
                As I have setup AdminRoute for secure Admin Dashboard, so user's and admin's dashboard fully separated and secure. No one can access here.
        </li>
        <li>
                Also can shipped any order or cancel any order as it's an Admin Dashboard
